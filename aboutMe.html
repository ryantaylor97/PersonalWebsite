	<h3>Courses Taken</h3>
	<p>
		I've taken 5 Computer Science classes during my college career. Data Structures, Discrete Structers, Programming II, Programming 1301 and 1302. Over the course of those 5, I recieved a 3.3 GPA while learning a mixture of C, C++ and Java. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of objected oriented programming, memory management, version control and unit testing.

	<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
	<p>
		 Of my own accord, I have begun working on my own text editor, aptly named the “TaylorTextPad”. It allows for font changing, saving and opening of files, as well as compiling and running Java code. Once run, the output is written to a console attached to the text editor. Recently, I have begun collaborating with a fellow CS student in pursuit of further improvements on “TaylorTextPad”. Over the course of my time working on it, I have learned about several topics beyond my course’s breadth, including multithreading, version control, advanced GUI skills and file management. I've also attached my <a href="Images\CTR.docx">resume</a>. Lastly, at the 2017 Mercer Spring Programming Contest, my partner and I were the first GC&amp;SU students to place first in their division at a programming competition. We will compete again in this weekend, hopefully performing even better.
